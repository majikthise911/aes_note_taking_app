## Key Questions:

1. **When should multiple topics stay in ONE note vs be split?**
   - Example: If I write about budget AND schedule in same paragraph, should it be:
     - A) One note in the primary category
     - B) Two separate notes (one for budget, one for schedule)

2. **What indicates a NEW note should be created?**
   - Different topic?
   - Line break?
   - Different day/meeting?
   - Something else?

3. **For Action Items:**
   - Should action items be SEPARATE notes or can they be bullet points within a larger note?
   - Example: "Meeting with vendor. Budget approved. AES to follow up on drawings."
     - Split into 3 notes? Or keep as 1 note with action item as a bullet?

4. **What's your typical note-taking style?**
   - Long paragraphs covering multiple topics?
   - Short discrete notes?
   - Meeting notes with multiple items?
   - Mix of all?
